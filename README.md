# üõçÔ∏è Basic Amazon Clone using HTML and CSS

This project is a front-end replica of the Amazon homepage, crafted using only HTML and CSS. It mirrors key sections of the original site ‚Äî including the navigation bar, hero section, product showcases, and footer ‚Äî with a strong focus on layout, styling, and responsiveness. Built as a learning project, it showcases my foundational skills in web development and design.

## üí° Features

- Top navigation bar with logo, location, search bar, language selector, and cart icon
- Interactive product cards laid out using flexbox
- Hero section with a promotional message and background image
- Organized footer with multiple panels just like on Amazon
- Use of Font Awesome icons for better UI
- Clean and simple layout styled entirely with CSS

üß† Concepts Learned
- While working on this project, I learned the following web development concepts:
- Linking and using Font Awesome icons for UI elements.
- How to download and implement images from websites into a project.
- Usage of border-box to include padding and border within element dimensions.
- Using rem units for responsive font sizing.
- Understanding and implementing Flexbox for layout.
- align-items: center and justify-content: center for element alignment.
- The purpose and use of the <span> tag in inline styling.
- Importance of flex-wrap: wrap; for handling content overflow.

üìå What Future Improvements i will bring in this project

‚û§ Add JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., dynamic cart updates, user sign-in simulation).

‚û§ Make the layout fully responsive using media queries.

‚û§ Optimize image loading using modern formats like WebP.

‚û§ I plan to recreate this project using React.js once I learn it, to make the structure more modular and efficient.
